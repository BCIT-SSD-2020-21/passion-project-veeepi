# Passion Project
[GitHub Assignment Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/iu7cOFBC)
## Overview
The goal of the Passion Project module is to provide each student with an opportunity to individually explore and expand their abilities within a hands-on project-based setting.

The student will perform all roles including:
* Product Owner
* Product Designer/Planner
* Project Manager
* Designer
* Dev Ops
* Developer

Students are encouraged to work independantly (or in small groups of 2 or 3 if there is a shared passion). 

Students are able to use the tech stack of their choice. 

## Outcomes
Leading up to this point in our program you were asked to plan, design, and start to develop a product of your choosing. Given your increased experience with web and mobile technologies, you will be provided with class time to perform the tasks necessary to result in the following:

* A deployed main branch of any web based project assets.
* A clearly defined document with installation instructions as well as links and descriptions for all project assets.
* A project board that shows all of your build activitites (GitHub Project, Trello, etc.)
* A 5 minute presentation of the primary use cases for your application.

## Process
* Review your original product plan and design.
* Make changes to your plan/design where necessary to ensure that you can have a completed product for the Passion project demo day.
* Set specific milestones for your project, this will help to ensure that primary use cases are built in priority sequence and functional to a required minimum. (Not all milestones need to be completed...)
* All commits are to be done on a branch other than main and connected to a GitHub "issue". If working alone you can review and merge your own pull requests.

## Essential Features
These are really based on the design of your application and up to you...The only requirements are that each application has:
* some form persistant data that requires a database
* an implementation of a user interface that appropriately ties the app to the persisted data.

All other features should be included on an as needed basis for your application.

## Due Date and Grading
Presentations will take place 1pm-4pm PST April 16th, 2021.

The due date for graded code to be on GitHub is 11:59pm April 18th, 2021.

The passion project accounts for 20% of your SSDP5001 mark. 

**SSDP5001 Weighting**
* Career Success Series (13.33%)
* Passion Project (20%)
* Industry Project (66.67%)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
